			I currently make use of a Macbook Pro (a touchbar
			model). It is an impressive machine and the only
			complaint I have so far is my <span class="is-italic">keyboards getting
			stuck regular</span>. It is also maxed out at 16gigs
		        of RAM, that is not an issue until I have to run this
			fucking Electron apps.

		        I currently make use of an Apple Airpods for my <span
				       class="is-italic">Music while coding
			</span> needs... Definitely not on par with those Bose
			noise cancelling ones, but I do love the flexibility it
			provides.
