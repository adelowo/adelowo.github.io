			I currently make use of a Macbook Pro (a touchbar
			model). It is an impressive machine and the only
			complaint I have so far is my <span class="is-italic">keyboards getting
			stuck regularly</span>. It is also maxed out at 16gigs
		        of RAM, that is not an issue until I have to run this
			fucking Electron apps.

		        I currently make use of an Apple Airpods for my <span
				       class="is-italic">Music while coding
			</span> needs... Definitely not on par with those Bose
			noise cancelling ones, but I do love the flexibility it
			provides.

			I depend on Safari for surfing the internet. It is
			lightweight, isn't Chrome or runs on Electron plus Handoff works like a
			charm between my Mac and iPhone - I don't have Chrome on
			mobile either.

			I use <a href="https://www.notion.so/?r=5b518286c0514cd797ef9a61e4dadd93">Notion</a> for taking
			notes and everything in between. I used to use Bear but
			Notion is just a beast. Thinking of it again, I am like
			who doesn't like
			<span class="is-italic">How to tame a dragon ?</span>
