title : GDG DevFest 2016 Lagos - My Take

---

My first event/meetup/conference of any sort and i was completely overwhelmed

> TL;DR - I met (and spoke to) [Segun Famisa](http://segunfamisa.com), [Unicodedeveloper](https://twitter.com/unicodedeveloper) and I did feel fulfilled  - at least to me, that was the defining point of the entire event. The talks were great but pulling a discussion with this guys was beyond awesome.

Sometime this past June, I decided i wanted to become a part of the Nigerian developers' community, meet some techies and all that kind of thing. It was fast becoming a possibility when a 3-day hackathon was organised by the guys at Brindocorp - [link here](http://techcabal.com/2016/09/07/isdev-hackathon/). Hell, I could meet a couple handful awesome developers who are like **me<sup>100</sup>**. A thing led to another and i had to pull out from attending.

Then the other day, I was on [Techcabal](http://techcabal.com) and i found something like ___Awesome events you can attend this November___. That led to this post.

### The Beginning

I got to the event around <time>09:58</time>. Had to go through the verification process plus get an an android robot sticker. While doing all of this, I pulled up a conversation with a certain dude from ___FUNAAB___ who was into embedded systems but was hoping to make a transition to the ***web***. We chatted for 20 mins and we ended up sitting beside each other at the main event.

# The Talks

## The state of the web by Celestine

> This was actually the keynote address

This made me thankful for the fact that i did not live in the era when deploying web apps via FTP was the bomb - LOL right ?. 

Or when ___IE___ was a major developer bane.
 
Or when you had to be a nerd to implement ***AJAX***.

Or when VCS wasn't for ___mere mortals___.

Or when you had to empty your account for a server.


## Firebase for the web (UnicodeDeveloper)

> [Here are the slides](https://speakerdeck.com/unicodeveloper/firebase-for-the-web)

Awesome presentation. I never knew Firebase had that much in store. While he was talking about firebase storage, i made a mental note to ask about it's comparison with s3 but [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13957446/4301733) answered my question.

He also brought his ___twitterism___ to the event

## Empathy (Udeze Kene)

> [Here are the slides] (https://speakerdeck.com/udezekene/empathy-in-design)

This happens to be my favorite talk from the event. When he came on stage and said he was a UI/UX guy (lead at CCHub), I was like ___No, This is not happening___. I do not like design by any means and would rather have ___my balls kicked___ than have to sit with anything that has to with design.

But this talk blew my mind off. This talk was great but it still isn't going to make me UI/UX centric.

I feel this topic transcends UI/UX and has had a great impact on the way i think about code i have been writing since his talk ended. I currently am reading the book, ___Clean Code : A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship___ by Uncle Bob and i found this talk happens to be applicable to the awesome stuff i am learning from the book. It was all about connecting the dots.

A search on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/udezekene) and Youtube revealed this guy is so much hooked on stuffs like this. Here is a certain video - had to put it on replay, pause, take some notes, play - that made me publish the post 3 hours past scheduled time.

By all means, ___Empathy___ would be applied as one of my top 2017 ___lifehacks___.


## Progressive Web Apps by Ireade.

> [Here are the slides](https://speakerdeck.com/ireade/building-modern-progressive-web-apps)

Progressive web apps are the future. Yes they are. You find headlines like this on some random blog on Google and you still do not understand why they are the future. Here is a presentation you should checkout.

If there's anything i have learnt from Ireade in the last few months i have been stalking her works online, that would be the ability to ___pay attention to details___. Ire is pretty much obsessed with browser support and details ([Check this](https://operamini.tips/#/), [or her blog](https://www.bitsofco.de) or the slides...)

The other talks were : 
 
- Polymer by Lynda Chiwetelu ([HotelsNg](https://hotels.ng)) [Slides here](https://speakerdeck.com/lyndachiwetelu/dive-into-polymer-gdg-southwest-devfest-2016) - she seemed exhausted and i didn't really enjoy her talk even though the topic was nice enough and there was a lot of trendy JS stuff (shadow DOM, blah blah) in there.

- Google Cloud Storage - Big query [Google docs here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N3HurNoGQZ-58IdFGHsipl2QNNQQdU3KuvvEztvTeCQ/edit#slide=id.g19c9955361_0_2298) by Nosakhare Belvi - Awesome presentation, was actually more of a workshop kind of thing - since he endeavoured everyone to follow along. And it's nice how he walked us through the whole setup. That sentence might sound trivial but there is a lot going on and it is easy to ___shoot yourself in the foot___ while doing this. The bad parts (**and they are in no way his fault**) of his talk were :
    - Time constraint : He was told multiple times to speed things up but he wanted to make sure everyone really got a grip of what he was doing.
    - Big Query : ___This product just happens to be so unlike Google___. Billing has to be enabled for this product to work and no was going to get charged for something (s)he used in a <time>45 mins</time> session.
    

### The End

I had the honorable pleasure of meeting and speaking with [Femi Taiwo](https://twitter.com/dftaiwo), [Segun Famisa](http://segunfamisa.com) and [unicodeveloper](https://twitter.com/unicodeveloper). They all were extremely helpful and were eager to talk with some ___random dude___. 

I couldn't really get unicodeveloper's attention because everyone wanted to talk with him. He literally was having a conversation with 8 persons at once - plus another 12 waiting in line while listening to the conversation he was already holding -. But still, it was awesome.

Segun Famisa was nice - like super nice - and humble . I walked up to him while he was on his phone - probably chatting - and was like ___Good Evening___, obviously he was too busy on his device but he turned around to check the ___talking harry___ some seconds later. And he ended up talking about my ___impostors' syndrome___, his blog, React Native and some other interesting things. 

GDG DEVFEST was awesome. Can we do that some other time ? Hell Yeah!!!

> This post was written as per Segun Famisa's instruction. He was like __Write something. Hmm, that's hard. Ok write about this event__.

> In strict accordance with the response, advice i got from him (Segun), I plan to write at least 2 blog posts a month starting from December.
