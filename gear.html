			I currently make use of a 2016 15" Macbook Pro. It is an impressive machine and the only
			complaint I have so far is my <span class="is-italic">keyboards getting
			stuck regularly</span>. It is also maxed out at 16gigs
		        of RAM, that is not an issue until I have to run this
			fucking Electron apps.
		</p>
		<p>
		        I currently make use of an Apple Airpods for my <span
				       class="is-italic">Music while coding
			</span> needs... Definitely not on par with those Bose
			noise cancelling ones, but I do love the flexibility it
			provides.

		<p> I am a <a class="is-tomato" href="/blog/2017/08/08/on-vim/">vim enthusiast
		</a> and swear by Tmux. </p>

			I depend on Safari for surfing the internet. It is
			lightweight, isn't Chrome or runs on Electron plus Handoff works like a
			charm between my Mac and iPhone - I don't have Chrome on
			mobile either.

			I use <a class="is-tomato" href="https://www.notion.so/?r=5b518286c0514cd797ef9a61e4dadd93">Notion</a>
			for taking notes and everything in between. Bear used to
			be my preferred tool but Notion is literally everything
			Bear is - plus Trello, Google notes and others. It's a
			beast. Thinking of it again, I am like who doesn't like <span class="is-italic">How to tame a dragon ?</span>
