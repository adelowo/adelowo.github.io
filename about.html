   	   		I am Lanre Adelowo, a fullstack clown - with a black nose
			( we are rare, snapchat filters don't count).
		</p>

		<p>
		    I am a software developer by day, night and in my dreams.
       Here in Nigeria, the society thinks I am a <span
       class="is-italic"> Yahoo yahoo boy </span>, which by the way is a terrible synonym for
       <span class="is-italic is-capitalized">The nigerian prince</span>.
		</p>

		<p>
			This days, I code mostly in Go. In a previous life, I
		        wrote a lot of PHP where I fell in love with
			SlimPHP and Laravel. I also write Ruby (
			no Rails).

		</p>

		<p>
			Prior to modern day civilization, I wrote a lot of Javascript.
		</p>

		<p>
			I love open source and
			try my best to <a href="https://github.com/adelowo"
				class="is-tomato">contribute as much as i can</a>.
   			I also try to write a lot. Here is my <a
				class="is-tomato" href="/blog">blog</a> even though I actually end up writing more code
			than blog posts. ^__^ .
